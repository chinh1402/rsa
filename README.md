### RSA DEMO

Here's my code that can be used to test RSA algorithm. It was made for demonstration purposes. 
Sources for references: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/ 

Functionality:
- Can be used to encrypt, and decrypt small numbers (preferred 2 random prime numbers, any), 4 digits prime is the maximum 
- Showing the list of possible e values can be found. The default e value is the first value in the list. 
- Dissect e and d into a sum of numbers that has the power of 2. Then calculating its corresponding modulo values to serve the purpose of calculating by hand.
